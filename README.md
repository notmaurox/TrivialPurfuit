# TrivialPurfuit final deliverable for Foundations of Software Engineering Class

This project was an exercise in demonstrating our ability to carry out key phases in the software development life cycle via code and documentation deliverables. We scoped requirements, identigied system components, completed design and use case diagrams, and incrementally built the code base from a skeletal outline to a functioning product.
